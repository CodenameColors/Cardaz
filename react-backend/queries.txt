This is here so i can keep track of how to do what. Its going to help ALOT when setting up the main API

Here's how to grab every column, for all the rows of one patient. EACH TABLE.
SELECT * FROM patient LEFT OUTER JOIN address ON patient.id = address.patient_id        inner join heartdata ON patient.id = heartdata.patient_id;

Here's how to grab the record data for the web page to display
SELECT patient.id, patient.first_name, patient.last_name, patient.phone_number,
address.street, address.city, address.state, address.zip_code
FROM patient inner join address
ON patient.id = address.patient_id;
